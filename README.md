# Model Deployment

This is my attempt to learn model deployment using Docker Container in production environment.

## Flow:

- Create a ML model that need to deployed in production.

- Use flask to expose the model as a microservice.

- Deploy the microservice using a docker container on apache/nginx web server to allow access to end users.
